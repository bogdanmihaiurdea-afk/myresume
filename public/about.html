<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a motivated and adaptable professional with a strong background in customer service, sales, and client relations, gained through several years of experience in both international and local companies. Working in fast-paced environments has helped me develop excellent communication skills, patience, and the ability to handle complex situations with calm and efficiency.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have developed a strong interest in web development and digital technologies. I enjoy learning and applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I am particularly passionate about understanding how the web works behind the scenes and continuously improving my technical skills through practice and self-study.</p>
<p>Beyond my professional interests, I value creativity, discipline, and continuous personal growth. I enjoy solving problems, learning new skills, and taking on challenges that help me evolve both personally and professionally. My goal is to combine my people-oriented experience with technical knowledge to create meaningful digital experiences.</p>
